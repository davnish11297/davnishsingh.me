              <h2 class="card-title">Apple releases iOS 11.3, the biggest update for iPhones since iOS 11 first launched</h2>
              <p class="card-text">
              Today, Apple released iOS 11.3 to all supported devices, including the iPad Air and later, the iPad mini 2 and later, the iPhone 5S and later, and the sixth-generation iPod touch. The update is available for download now in supported regions.<br/><br/>
              
              With several new features, it's arguably the biggest update to iOS since iOS 11 first released. iOS 11.3 addresses battery-based performance throttling on older devices, adds significant new capabilities for augmented reality, adds the ability to chat with customer support reps from companies in Messages, and lets users access their personal health records in the Health app.<br/><br/>
              
              Apple also released smaller updates for tvOS (tvOS 11.3) on the Apple TV and watchOS (watchOS 4.3), as well as macOS High Sierra 10.13.4, which adds eGPU support and Business Chat to Macs. Let's dive into what each of these updates adds for users.<br/>
              
              As promised, Apple has made it possible to disable performance throttling on older iPhones whose batteries have degraded to the point that they pose a risk for unexpected shutdowns resulting from voltage shortages. Apple lists this as a beta feature.<br/><br/>
              
              <blockquote>This is a measure of battery capacity relative to when it was new. Lower capacity may result in fewer hours of usage between charges.</blockquote><br/><br/>
              
              As always, there are numerous security updates for all three of these releases that are not included in the regular patch notes. Apple shares these notes in the security updates hub on its support site, with dedicated pages for iOS 11.3, watchOS 4.3, and tvOS 11.3.

              <h2 class="card-title">Mark Zuckerberg has regrets: 'I'm really sorry that this happened'</h2>
              <p class="card-text">"I'm really sorry that this happened," the Facebook (FB) CEO told CNN's Laurie Segall in an exclusive TV interview on Wednesday.<br/><br/>
              
              News broke this weekend that Cambridge Analytica, a data firm with ties to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, accessed information from 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge, and might have kept that data even after Facebook told the company to delete it.<br/><br/>
              
              Zuckerberg addressed the scandal publicly through a Facebook post on Wednesday. He wrote that the company made "mistakes" and outlined how it has changed its policies to make sure that user data is protected.<br/><br/>
              
              "I wish we'd taken those steps earlier," Zuckerberg told Segall. "That ... is probably the biggest mistake that we made here."<br/><br/>
              
              Aleksandr Kogan, the data scientist who passed along data to SCL Group and its affiliate Cambridge Analytica, built a Facebook app that drew data from users and their friends in 2013. He was allowed access to a broad range of data at the time.<br/><br/>
              
              Though Kogan's data was properly obtained, he breached Facebook's policy when he shared that information with a third party, Facebook has said. When Facebook learned about the information being shared, it asked Cambridge Analytica to destroy the data. Cambridge said it had.<br/><br/>
              
              <b>Zuckerberg said Facebook plans to alert everyone whose data was accessed by Cambridge Analytica. But he added that he wishes the company hadn't waited so long to tell people what happened.</b><br/><br/>
              
              "I started this when I was so young and inexperienced," the 33-year-old Zuckerberg said. "I made technical errors and business errors. I hired the wrong people. I trusted the wrong people," he said.<br/><br/>
              
              But ultimately, he said, he's learned from his missteps.

              I’ve got to work with Universal Studios back in 2016 for Fate of the Furious (Furious 8) as a trailer editor. It was one of me and my team’s preeminent time there working with such brilliant editors and production department.<br/><br/>
              Universal studios was my dream.<br/><br/>
              And to live this dream again, Universal studios just announced the release date of a movie Red Notice in association with Seven Bucks Productions and Davnish Editors Pvt. Ltd. that is our team.<br/><br/>
              Yes, we just got roped in for Red Notice movie’s official trailer and VFX. They loved our work and so they decided to get us onboard for this one.<br/><br/>
              I was at home when this happened, when i got a call from Universal and they told me about this. We just had a meeting and it turned out successful.<br/><br/>

              <p class="card-text"><b>Adrian Lamo, the computer hacker who turned in whistleblower Chelsea Manning to law enforcement, has died at the age of 37, according to authorities in Kansas.</b><br/><br/>
              
              Lamo, who testified about Manning’s release of documents to WikiLeaks, was confirmed dead on Friday by authorities in Sedgwick County. The coroner’s office has not responded to inquiries about the cause of his death.<br/><br/>
              
              Manning, a former soldier whose leaks exposed the nature of warfare in Afghanistan and Iraq, was released from military prison last year after Barack Obama commuted her 35-year sentence.<br/><br/>
              
              Lamo’s father, Mario, confirmed the death in a Facebook post on Friday that said: “With great sadness and a broken heart I have to let know all of Adrian’s friends and acquittances [sic] that he is dead. A bright mind and compassionate soul is gone, he was my beloved son.”<br/><br/>
              
              Called the “world’s most hated hacker” by some at the time, Lamo also said: “Had I done nothing, I would always have been left wondering whether the hundreds of thousands of documents that had been leaked to unknown third parties would end up costing lives, either directly or indirectly.”<br/><br/>

              <p class="card-text"><br>Stephen Hawking has died at the age of 76, his family has said.</br><br/>
              The British physicist was known for his work with black holes and relativity, and wrote several popular science books including A Brief History of Time.<br/><br/>

"We are deeply saddened that our beloved father passed away today," a family statement said.<br/>

At the age of 22 Stephen Hawking was given only a few years to live after being diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease.<br/><br/>

The illness left him wheelchair-bound and largely unable to speak except through a voice synthesiser.<br/><br/>

His family said that he died peacefully in his home near Cambridge University, where he did much of his ground-breaking work on black holes.<br/><br/>

He has always inspired me through his ground-breaking achievements and work done by him throughout his life.<br/><br/>

Today we all should remember him and pay our respect.<br/><br/>

You will always be our inspiration. GoodBye!!</p>

              <p class="card-text">Davnish Singh is currently doing undergraduation in Computer Science from Kwantlen Polytechnic University. He is also an undergraduate scholar at Stanford University currently working on some research papers on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning under Neural Networks in computer vision and pattern recognition.<br/><br/> 

Before starting his journey in Computer Science, he was doing under-graduation in Mechanical Engineering. But, he has always been inspired from algorithms and how computer systems works.<br/><br/>

So, he took a turn and taught himself basics of Web Development in 6 months in which he created many websites and projects. After gaining an experience in APIs and Development, he took various MOOCs on Algorithms.<br/><br/>

As a machine learning enthusiast, he always believed that by applying ML in the every field one can make a change and automate the regular tasks on hand to focus on other ones as well.<br/><br/>

In addition to his passion for Machine Learning and software technologies, he has got a strong passion for algorithms because he thinks that problems have to be solved instead of getting only discovered.<br/><br/>

He consider himself to be a very ambitious and dynamic person with a great curiosity for all those things which involve new technologies with a massive effect on people life.<br/><br/>

Actively looking for Software Engineering internship.
Graduate in June 2019.</p>
